I added a few things around my neighborhood that were not on Openmap such as a hotel and a clothing store. I also added a public street that is closed off to cars at 185th street. It is a part of the Yeshiva University. I had problems finding the right tag for that area so I could not specify what it was. Any feedback on what tag to use for this area would be great. 

I also removed buildings that no longer exist on Amsterdam and 181st. It used to be a gas station but it has been torn down and is now an empty lot perpetually under construction. There were also some mistakes on the nearby train station. It had a marker for a subway entrance that did not exist and also it had many duplicate markers on the path of the train so I deleted and moved a few of those on 181st street.

I added a public playgroud that is part of a public school. There is also a Dirt Jump Park where I would meet up with friends as kids and although the satellite picture doesn't show it very well, it does exist. I even linked to a pdf from the park directly that shows its existence. 

Lastly I added two charter schools. One is the TEP Early Childhood charter school which is now on the 2nd floor of what used to be a Social Security Office building. The second one is called Success Academy which now stands in place of a 115 year old catholic school that closed down a few years back called Mother Cabrini High School. All links with proof of this is provided in my history and edits
Many of these types of locations were not on Google so I made sure to cite them with the school's website or articles.
