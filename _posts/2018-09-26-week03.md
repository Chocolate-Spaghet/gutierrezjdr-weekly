## Assignment 5: 

For me the hardest part was understanding the role of an "upstream branch" and how that changed the process. I have worked with git but not with forks as much
so I thought this practice was very useful. Still i felt a little lost especially trying to remember when to commit and push as well as the difference between them.
Despite this, the assignment helped bring back the memories of how to use git especially whenI haven't used it in a long time. I  will for sure try a few practice problems
on remote branshing as this was the most confusing part for me in general.
